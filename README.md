# Password-cracking-analysis
A virtual work project aimed at cracking 20 passwords with Hash cat and developing a report suggesting reccomendations to be made
Because the project was run on the command line there is no file with the code, however I am providing the hashcat code line I used to crack the passwords
Code Line: hashcat -m0 -a3 cracked.txt hash.txt
